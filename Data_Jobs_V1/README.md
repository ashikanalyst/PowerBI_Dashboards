## Introduction

This dashboard was created for **Job Seekers, Job Transitioners, and Job Swappers** to solve a common problem: information about the data job market is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a *real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings* (including titles, salaries, and locations), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and compensation.

## Skills 

- **Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
- **Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like Median Yearly Salary and Job Count.
_ **Core Charts:** Utilized Column, Bar, Line, and Area Charts to compare job counts and track trends over time.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged Map Charts to visualize the global distribution of jobs.
- **KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used Cards to display key metrics and Tables to provide granular, sortable data.
- **Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
- **Interactive Reporting:**
  - **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
  - **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
  - **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.
